# A Coffee Shop Queuing Simulation

My Coffee Shop Simulation simulates customer arrivals, queue behavior, and service times in a coffee shop over a 3-hour period. This project was completed using Python for both the simulation logic and the backend tracking of customers and baristas. Python's library, Matplotlib, was used for graphing queue lengths, wait times, and comparing the performances between one and two baristas.
