# A Coffee Shop Queuing Simulation

This simulates customer arrivals, queue behavior, and service times in a coffee shop over a 3-hour period. Python was used for both the simulation logic and the backend tracking of customers and baristas. Python's library, Matplotlib, was used for graphing queue lengths, wait times, and comparing the performances between one and two baristas.
